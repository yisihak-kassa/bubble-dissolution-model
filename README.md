The mass transfer of gas $i$ in a rising bubble is governed by the following differential equation \citep{mc}:

```math
\frac{dM_i}{dz} = -K_{Li} \left( H_i P_i - C_i \right) \frac{4\pi r^2}{v_b}
```

where  
- $M_i$ is the mass of gas $i$ in the bubble (mol)  
- $K_{Li}$ is the mass transfer coefficient (m/s)  
- $H_i$ is Henryâ€™s law constant (mol/L bar)  
- $P_i$ is the partial pressure of gas $i$ (bar)  
- $C_i$ is the concentration of gas $i$ in the liquid phase (mol/L)  
- $r$ is the bubble radius (m)  
- $v_b$ is the bubble rise velocity (m/s).  

The term $4\pi r^2$ represents the bubble surface area. Since gas exchange occurs at the interface between the gas and liquid phases, this surface area directly influences the rate of mass transfer. The term $H_i P_i - C_i$ represents the concentration gradient that drives gas transfer. If the dissolved gas profile remains constant throughout the depth of the water column, then $C_i$ remains unchanged. In this case, the concentration gradient is determined solely by the partial pressure of gas $i$ inside the bubble.  

At greater depths, the total pressure in the bubble is higher, which increases the partial pressure of the gas compared to lower depths. Consequently, $H_i P_i$ becomes larger, resulting in a greater concentration gradient at these depths. However, as the bubbles ascend, the concentration gradient gradually decreases and approaches zero. This leads to a reduction in the rate of gas transfer with increasing travel distance.
